menuconfig LEDS_TRIGGERS
	bool "LED Trigger support"
	depends on LEDS_CLASS
	help
	  This option enables trigger support for the leds class.
	  These triggers allow kernel events to drive the LEDs and can
	  be configured via sysfs. If unsure, say Y.

if LEDS_TRIGGERS

config RTK_LEDS_TRIGGER_TIMER
	tristate "LED Timer Trigger"
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by a programmable timer
	  via sysfs. Some LED hardware can be programmed to start
	  blinking the LED without any further software interaction.
	  For more details read Documentation/leds/leds-class.rst.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTK_LEDS_TRIGGER_ONESHOT
	tristate "LED One-shot Trigger"
	help
	  This allows LEDs to blink in one-shot pulses with parameters
	  controlled via sysfs.  It's useful to notify the user on
	  sporadic events, when there are no clear begin and end trap points,
	  or on dense events, where this blinks the LED at constant rate if
	  rearmed continuously.

	  It also shows how to use the led_blink_set_oneshot() function.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config RTK_LEDS_TRIGGER_GPIO
	tristate "LED GPIO Trigger"
	depends on GPIOLIB || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  This allows LEDs to be controlled by gpio events. It's good
	  when using gpios as switches and triggering the needed LEDs
	  from there. One use case is n810's keypad LEDs that could
	  be triggered by this trigger when user slides up to show
	  keypad.

	  If unsure, say N.
